King Kashyapa, King Datusena’s eldest born son was talented in politics, war strategy and the arts as a prince ought to be. He was however, denied the throne and his younger step-brother King Mugallana who was the son of a royal consort was in line to be king. The vengeful Kashyapa hatched a plan with Migara, King Datusena’s army commander to rebel against his father.\n\n With Migara’s incitement and assistance, Prince Kashyapa overthrew King Datusena and usurped the throne. The former king was then imprisoned and later entombed into a wall. The end of the king is interpreted differently in various chronicles. \n\n King Kashyapa’s cruelty to his father and the repercussion of his action caused public rage and the disappointment and disgust of the priests. He was later referred to as the ‘Pithru Gathaka Kashyapa’ (Parricidal Kashyapa). The Prince Mugallana then fled to India.\n\nKing Kashyapa sought safety from the public fury and disgust and fled into a large, roughly lion-shaped rock that he then discovered. Thus, the kingdom of Sigiriya was born. The rock was elaborately designed with pools and lush green gardens and had dense forests protecting it from right round. The grand gardens of Sigiriya are said to be one of the world’s oldest landscaped gardens. The water system that remains a marvel and a mystery still function well during the rainy seasons and fills up the pools on all ground levels."

        description = "The mirror wall stairway leads up to the ruins of the Sigiriya lion’s paws sculpture. The name “Sigiriya Lion Rock” comes from this royal palace entrance. The original entrance was through a massive brick sculpture of a lion head. Only the paws of this sculpture remain at the foot of the rock today. A rare Sigiriya mirror wall poem describes how imposing the lion sculpture was at the time of his visit (Sometime between the sixth to thirteenth centuries). The stairway that leads to the top of Sigiriya rock starts from where the lion statue’s mouth would have been."
